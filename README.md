# Catalyst-Audit-Circle

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/1CWRy-5HR7Q" %}

Since October 2021 community members with an interest in auditing and oversight initiated research into reporting and participated in the **Catalyst Auditing working group** ( see [https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-auditing/admin/meetings](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-auditing/admin/meetings) ).

The **Catalyst Audit Circle** is tasked with:

* Listening to problems around auditability including use of the reporting system, confusion in the process and identifying bad actors.
* Prioritizing proposal audit issues with the help of the community. Looking at the complexity, implementation effort and relevant concerns to guide what to solve first.
* Coordinating and collaborating with the community to investigate and develop potential solutions to auditing issues. Any solutions developed can go through the Catalyst funding process.
