**12:40 - Stephen** - Where we are with deliverables

## 6) Scope & Deliverables of Audit Circle - 25 Minutes

All members - The present summary of Audit Circle’s scope is :

“_The Audit Circle will survey, facilitate retrospectives and report on funded proposal audit processes._”

## Survey deliverables

### 6.1 - The Funded Proposal reporting system - 10 minutes

### **6.1.1 - Qualitative data gathering (Survey deliverable)**

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

**Action from previous meetings :** Gather more qualitative data in respect of what should be on the funded proposal monthly reporting form. Go out to other funded proposers & gather informal feedback - Matthias

**16:24 - Matthias -** "_I do not have any real updates. The Fund 8 process is closing out, and now we're in voting and there is the dread of having to do reporting going forward. I was in a Twitter space where someone mentioned that they increased the budget a lot more because of the dread of reporting. And wished they did not get funded. And that's so odd thing to hear for me._"

### **6.1.2 - Google Form Design & Implementation (Survey deliverable)**

{% endhint %}

**Action from previous meetings :** A Google form that is short & easy to complete. Vanessa / Phil.

**18:34 - Vanessa - Updates**

According to the Fund 7 proposal we are to do an external and an internal survey.

#### **External survey**

I'm taking an external survey as meaning the funded proposals. And the Fund 7 proposal foregrounds their needs as not whether they are delivering on audit but more what do they need?

What are their issues and problems? A kind of problem sensing.

Identified three possible approaches that we could take. Because I do not think a Google form should be too long. It would be good to get from this meeting what would be the best angle to take?

**The first approach is about proposal attitudes to audit in general.**

Questions for that could include -

* What do proposers think about audit obligations?
* What do you think they should be?
* How do they perceive audit? Is it a burden?

**The second approach is about monitoring & data gathering.**

In the chat someone said that you can't audit if people don't gather data. From listening and talking to people I get the sense that many funded proposals don't have a clear idea of what data they must gather. A survey that asked whether that is true or not.

Sample questions would be:

* What are proposers measuring and counting?
* How are they collecting and storing that data?
* Do they feel confident that they know what to measure and how to store it?
* Is it verifiable?
* Is there a developing consensus within Catalyst on best practice?
* Is that informed by the needs of all sorts of projects? Or does it seem to be geared towards a certain type of project, and people are feeling that it doesn't fit in?

**The third approach would be the current audit process.**

This is a functional type of survey that asks -

* How did your proposal account for auditability?
* Are you doing that?
* How do you feel about the change to monthly monitoring forms?
* Any specific questions about the monitoring form? How do people feel about it?
* Do people go to the coordinator meetings? And if not, why not?
* Have they have contact with their challenge team or not? (People are perceiving Challenge teams as an audit process.)

**Ron** - 22:07 - What are we auditing ?

**Vanessa** - 22:31 - Scope is how funded proposers audit their projects.
