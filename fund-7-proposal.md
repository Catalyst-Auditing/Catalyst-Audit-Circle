#### **Fill in here any additional details**

### **Overview**

_(Conceived by George Lovegrove. Adapted by Stephen Whitenstall.)_

The Catalyst Circle has been an effective way to help problem sense and prioritise problems that can be solved by the community. This form of coordination and governance can also be applied to the auditing process of the Project Catalyst ecosystem.



Since October 2021 community members with an interest in auditing and oversight have initiated research into reporting and participated in the **Catalyst Auditing working group** ( see [https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-auditing/admin/meetings](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-auditing/admin/meetings) ).

The **Catalyst Audit Circle** would be tasked with:

* Listening to problems around auditability including use of the reporting system, confusion in the process and identifying bad actors.
* Prioritizing funded proposals issues with the help of the community by looking at the complexity, implementation effort and relevant concerns to guide what to solve first.
* Coordinating and collaborating with the community to investigate and develop potential solutions to auditing issues. Any solutions developed can go through the Catalyst funding process.

### **Catalyst Auditing Circle proposal Intent**

This proposal's intent is to problem sense and prioritize problems that can be solved by the community.

A complementary proposal "Community Governance Oversight" ( [https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Community-Governance-Oversight/383517-48088](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Community-Governance-Oversight/383517-48088) ) will provide oversight of improvements to and innovations in Catalyst Governance.
