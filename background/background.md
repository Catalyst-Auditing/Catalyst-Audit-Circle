# Background

## **Catalyst Auditing working group**

Since October 2021 community members with an interest in auditing and oversight initiated research into reporting and participated in the **Catalyst Auditing working group** ( see [https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-auditing/admin/meetings](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-auditing/admin/meetings) ).

## **Catalyst Audit Hub Proposal**

The **Catalyst Audit Hub's objectives were** :

* Listen to problems around auditability including use of the reporting system, confusion in the process and identifying bad actors.
* Prioritize proposal audit issues with the help of the community. Looking at the complexity, implementation effort and relevant concerns to guide what to solve first.
* Coordinate and collaborate with the community to investigate and develop potential solutions to auditing issues. Any solutions developed can go through the Catalyst funding process.

**Legitimacy** - the [Fund 7 proposal](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/381354) together with the team listed were successfully voted for in February 2022.

**Transparency** - meetings, proposal reporting and deliverables are all documented in this GitBook.

**Accountability** - Catalyst Audit Circle is accountable to ADA holders who voted for it's proposal to deliver surveys, retrospectives and a final report by June 2022.
