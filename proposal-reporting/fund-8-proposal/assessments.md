# Assessments



## Assessment 1

### Impact / Alignment

The proposal is a continuation of the Catalyst Audit Circle form F7. The proposal wants to create/renew a Catalyst Auditing Circle which will be engaged in improving auditing structures and mechanisms in the funds to come/funding is for 2 months/ and by doing so the proposal will address the challenge objectives very well. The proposal states that the Catalyst Circle has been an effective tool and wants to replicate the success of it in the auditing domain. The proposal intends to bring transparency to the use of the treasury funds and bring innovation and experiments in the processes of auditing the proposals. I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.

### Feasibility

The proposing team is well presented and very experienced in the Catalyst ecosystem and has a high visibility. Many members of the team have proven track record with the community. A lot of the members delivered on previous proposals that they were funded for. The qualifications and the experience of the team will meet the requirement for achieving the goals set in the proposal. The proposal has an action plan with a timeline. The detail is lacking maybe due to the flexible nature of a sensing array. The budget is very well explained and detailed, as one would expect from a proposal regarding auditability. The budget is sufficient, even on the higher side for what is promised. I strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.

### Auditability

The auditability of the project is ensured by records on github that will consist of all documents, analysis, surveys, research, etc. that the circle will create. Unfortunately the proposers have not explicitly stated milestones and benchmarks and deadlines against which the progress could be measured. However since the end of this project is in 3 months with a closing report (that is stated) there is not much leeway for procrastination. I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.
