# Assessments



## Assessment 1

### Impact / Alignment

The proposal is a continuation of the Catalyst Audit Circle form F7. The proposal wants to create/renew a Catalyst Auditing Circle which will be engaged in improving auditing structures and mechanisms in the funds to come/funding is for 2 months/ and by doing so the proposal will address the challenge objectives very well. The proposal states that the Catalyst Circle has been an effective tool and wants to replicate the success of it in the auditing domain. The proposal intends to bring transparency to the use of the treasury funds and bring innovation and experiments in the processes of auditing the proposals. I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.

### Feasibility

The proposing team is well presented and very experienced in the Catalyst ecosystem and has a high visibility. Many members of the team have proven track record with the community. A lot of the members delivered on previous proposals that they were funded for. The qualifications and the experience of the team will meet the requirement for achieving the goals set in the proposal. The proposal has an action plan with a timeline. The detail is lacking maybe due to the flexible nature of a sensing array. The budget is very well explained and detailed, as one would expect from a proposal regarding auditability. The budget is sufficient, even on the higher side for what is promised. I strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.

### Auditability

The auditability of the project is ensured by records on github that will consist of all documents, analysis, surveys, research, etc. that the circle will create. Unfortunately the proposers have not explicitly stated milestones and benchmarks and deadlines against which the progress could be measured. However since the end of this project is in 3 months with a closing report (that is stated) there is not much leeway for procrastination. I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

## Assessment 2

### Impact / Alignment

As Cardano transitions towards a system run by the community, there are various projects pursued by the community that try to enhance governance mechanisms towards independence from their initial creators. Here we have another example where the Catalyst Audit Circle process is asking for continuation funds for a project already funded in prior rounds. Being a process spearheaded by active members of the Catalyst ecosystem, I am confident that their proposed activity is already beneficial to the community and can definitely be scaled towards other systems in need of similar improvements if the need arises.

### Feasibility

The proposers are all active members of the Cardano community, so in terms of the skills and competencies they possess, I have no worry whatsoever that they will be able to deliver on their promises. The project has received funding under previous rounds, so current work is due to continue until May 2022. Funding it for the future would extend the work until September this year. Remuneration for members is roughly 1k USD / person (up to 10 members max) for 1.5 days of work. The rest of the budget shall be used towards deliverables, for instance research, polls, survey or reports and other fixed costs.

### Auditability

Being an initiative already live, the community has a good idea on what kind of work the Circle performs, what their tasks are and what deliverables look like. There is of course public information available of past work and this project would be tracked and put in practice / communicated in a similar fashion. Success factors are measured by excellent indicators, and here a few below: - Lack of a central entity that controls improvements or innovations to auditing of funding proposals - participants performing audits of funded proposals are indeed accountable to the community - the audit processes are clear and transparent - audit culture is legitime (personal note - very important! - i know since i am intimately involved in audits myself) In conclusion, this Catalyst mechanism is extremely important, and if you wish to increase its activity over time, do vote for this proposal

## Asssessment 3

### Impact / Alignment

This Proposal addresses the challenge setting. The proposal seeks to increase the audibility of the Cardano community. The problems of audibility are listened to and identified such as reporting system, confusion in the process and identifying bad actors by the team that will work as the proposal is funded, and finding a way they can work to solve the problem. the risk of the proposal is also identified. They have talked about the lack of liaison with IOG and the lack of awareness and all of these have been given a clear description and a solution.

### Feasibility

The is a well-defined resource allocation and experience that will be suitable for the proposal. This proposal has taken listed meetings, report procedures, output, and much other relevant information to show how the proposal will be carried out. The budget lineup has also been presented in detail and sources uses are have been accounted for for the success of the proposal. Given experience and plans presented, it is highly likrly this proposal will be implemented successfully.

### Auditability

This proposal has been laid out in an organized manner. The is a chronological schedule of activities. all activities are directed at a specific time making it easy to track the process and success if funded. There is a detailed budget that allows easy tracking of the use of funds. The key metrics follow that of the campaign and therefore can be used to assess the success of the proposal.
